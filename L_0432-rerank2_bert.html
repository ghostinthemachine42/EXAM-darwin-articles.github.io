<div><h1>Darwin's theory of evolution</h1><p>Query Id: tqa2:L_0432</p><p>Run: ReRank2_BERT</p><ol><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">In 1859, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Charles</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"> </a><span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"></a> placed the whole <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of organic <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so. This changed the attitudes of most exponents of the scientific method. <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s discoveries revolutionised the zoological and botanical sciences, by introducing the <span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory">theory</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"></a> of <span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">natural</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">selection</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"></a> as an explanation for the diversity of all <span class="facetterm-span">animal</span> and <span class="facetterm-span">plant</span> life. The subject-matter of this new science, or branch of biological science, had been neglected: it did not form part of the studies of the collector and systematist, nor was it a branch of anatomy, nor of the physiology pursued by medical men, nor again was it included in the field of microscopy and the cell <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>. Almost a thousand years before <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>, the Arab scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">Al</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">-</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">Jahiz</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz"></a> (781 – 868) had already developed a rudimentary <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of natural selection , describing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">Struggle</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">for</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">existence</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"></a> in his Book of <span class="facetterm-span">Animals</span> where he speculates on how environmental factors can affect the characteristics of species by forcing them to adapt and then passing on those new traits to future generations. However, his work had largely been forgotten, along with many other early advances of Arab <span class="facetterm-span">scientists</span>, and there is no evidence that his works were known to <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">Thus punctuated equilibrium contradicts some of <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span>, but generally accords with <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> by natural selection.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">Precise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> developed his provisional <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangenesis">pangenesis</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangenesis"></a>. In 1865, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor%20Mendel"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor%20Mendel">Mendel</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor%20Mendel"></a> reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance">independent</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance">assortment</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance"></a> and segregation of elements (later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene">gene</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"></a>s). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s pangenesis <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August%20Weismann">August</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August%20Weismann"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August%20Weismann">Weismann</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August%20Weismann"></a> made the important distinction between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ%20cell">germ</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ%20cell"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ%20cell">cell</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ%20cell"></a>s that give rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete">gamete</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"></a>s (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm">sperm</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg%20cell">egg</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg%20cell"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg%20cell">cell</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg%20cell"></a>s) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic%20cell">somatic</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic%20cell"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic%20cell">cell</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic%20cell"></a>s of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries">Hugo</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries">de</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries">Vries</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20de%20Vries"></a> connected <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s pangenesis <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s pangenes were concentrated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20nucleus">cell</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20nucleus"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20nucleus"></a> and when expressed they could move into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"></a> to change the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20(biology)">cell</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell%20(biology)"></a>s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Fisher"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Fisher">Fisher</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Fisher"></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall%20Wright">Sewall</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall%20Wright"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall%20Wright">Wright</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall%20Wright"></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">J</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">. </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">B</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">. </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">S</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">. </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">Haldane</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane"></a> set the foundations of <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>, genetic mutations, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance">inheritance</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian%20inheritance"></a> was thus reconciled.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">While he did not originate the term, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Charles</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"> </a><span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"></a> identified the argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction of the <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> at the outset. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">The</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">Origin</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">of</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">Species</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species"></a> (1859), he wrote, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span>.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">The</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle"> </a><span class="facetterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">voyage</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">of</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">the</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle"> </a><span class="facetterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">Beagle</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle"></a> brought the survey ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Beagle">HMS</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Beagle"> </a><span class="facetterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Beagle">Beagle</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Beagle"></a>, under captain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20FitzRoy">Robert</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20FitzRoy"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20FitzRoy">FitzRoy</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20FitzRoy"></a>, to the Galápagos on 15 September 1835 to survey approaches to harbours.

Primarily a geologist at the time, <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> was impressed by the quantity of volcanic craters they saw, later referring to the archipelago as "that land of craters." His study of several volcanic formations over the 5 weeks he stayed in the islands, led to several important geological discoveries, including the first, correct explanation for how volcanic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff">tuff</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff"></a> is formed. <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> noticed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird">mockingbird</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingbird"></a>s differed between islands, though he thought the birds now known as <span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches">Darwin</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches">'</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches">s</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches"> </a><span class="facetterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches">finches</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's%20finches"></a> were unrelated to each other, and did not bother labelling them by island. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas%20Lawson">Nicholas</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas%20Lawson"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas%20Lawson">Lawson</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas%20Lawson"></a>, acting Governor of Galápagos for the Republic of the Equator, met them on Charles Island, and as they walked to the prison colony, Lawson told <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> the <span class="facetterm-span">tortoises</span> differed from island to island. Towards the end of the <span class="facetterm-span">voyage</span>, <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> speculated that the distribution of the mockingbirds and the <span class="facetterm-span">tortoises</span> might "undermine the stability of Species". When specimens of birds were analysed on his return to England, it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species of <span class="facetterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch">finch</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch"></a>es, which were unique to islands.

Almost a thousand years before <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>, the Arab scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">Al</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">-</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz">Jahiz</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz"></a> (781 – 868) had already developed a rudimentary <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> of natural selection , describing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">Struggle</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">for</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection">existence</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20selection"></a> in his Book of <span class="facetterm-span">Animals</span> where he speculates on how environmental factors can affect the characteristics of species by forcing them to adapt and then passing on those new traits to future generations. However, his work had largely been forgotten, along with many other early advances of Arab <span class="facetterm-span">scientists</span>, and there is no evidence that his works were known to <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">The major sticking point for many in the question of human <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved.
