<div><div><h1>Darwin's theory of evolution</h1><p>tqa2:L_0432</p><p>Charles
 Darwin is one of the best-known scientists of all time. Figure 7.1 
shows Darwin as a young man in the 1830s. Why is Darwin so famous? His 
theory of evolution was a major leap forward in human understanding. It 
explains and unifies all of life science. </p><p>Darwin proposed the 
theory of evolution by natural selection. Evolution is a change in the 
inherited traits of organisms over time. Natural selection is the 
process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more 
offspring, so their traits become more common over time. During Darwins 
voyage on the Beagle, he made many observations that helped him form his
 theory of evolution. Some of his most important observations were made 
on the Galpagos Islands. They included observations of giant tortoises 
and finches. Darwin was also influenced by his knowledge of artificial 
selection and the ideas of Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. Darwin spent 
many years working on a book about his theory of evolution by natural 
selection. He finally published On the Origin of Species in 1859. </p><h2>what is Darwin's theory</h2><p>T_2583</p><p>Darwins
 theory of evolution by natural selection contains two major ideas: One 
idea is that evolution happens. Evolution is a change in the inherited 
traits of organisms over time. Living things have changed as descendants
 diverged from common ancestors in the past. The other idea is that 
evolution occurs by natural selection. Natural selection is the process 
in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring. As
 a result, their traits increase in the population over time. </p><h2>voyage of the Beagle</h2><p>T_2584</p><p>How
 did Darwin come up with the theory of evolution by natural selection? A
 major influence was an amazing scientific expedition he took on a ship 
called the Beagle. Darwin was only 22 years old when the ship set sail. 
The trip lasted for almost five years and circled the globe. Figure 7.2 
shows the route the ship took. It set off from Plymouth, England in 
1831. It wouldnt return to Plymouth until 1836. Imagine setting out for 
such an incredible adventure at age 22, and youll understand why the 
trip had such a big influence on Darwin. Darwins job on the voyage was 
to observe and collect specimens whenever the ship went ashore. This 
included plants, animals, rocks, and fossils. Darwin loved nature, so 
the job was ideal for him. During the long voyage, he made many 
observations that helped him form his theory of evolution. Some of his 
most important observations were made on the Galpagos Islands. The 16 
Galpagos Islands lie 966 kilometers (about 600 miles) off the west coast
 of South America. (You can see their location on the map in Figure 
7.2.) Some of the animals Darwin observed on the islands were giant 
tortoises and birds called finches. Watch this video for an excellent 
introduction to Darwin, his voyage, and the Galpagos: </p><h2>giant tortoises</h2><p>T_2585</p><p>The
 Galpagos Islands are still famous for their giant tortoises. These 
gentle giants are found almost nowhere else in the world. Darwin was 
amazed by their huge size. He was also struck by the variety of shapes 
of their shells. You can see two examples in Figure 7.3. Each island had
 tortoises with a different shell shape. The local people even could 
tell which island a tortoise came from based on the shape of its shell. 
Darwin wondered how each island came to have its own type of tortoise. 
He found out that tortoises with dome- shaped shells lived on islands 
where the plants they ate were abundant and easy to reach. Tortoises 
with saddle- shaped shells, in contrast, lived on islands that were 
drier. On those islands, food was often scarce. The saddle shape of 
their shells allowed tortoises on those islands to reach up and graze on
 vegetation high above them. This made sense, but how had it happened? </p><h2>Darwin's finches</h2><p>T_2586</p><p>Darwin
 also observed that each of the Galpagos Islands had its own species of 
finches. The finches on different islands had beaks that differed in 
size and shape. You can see four examples in Figure 7.4. Darwin 
investigated further. He found that the different beaks seemed to suit 
the birds for the food available on their island. For example, finch 
number 1 in Figure 7.4 used its large, strong beak to crack open and eat
 big, tough seeds. Finch number 4 had a long, pointed beak that was 
ideal for eating insects. This seemed reasonable, but how had it come 
about? </p><h2>plant and animal breeding</h2><p>T_2588</p><p>Darwin knew
 that people could breed plants and animals to have useful traits. By 
selecting which individuals were allowed to reproduce, they could change
 an organisms traits over several generations. Darwin called this type 
of change in organisms artificial selection. You can see an example in 
Figure 7.5. Keeping and breeding pigeons was a popular hobby in Darwins 
day. Both types of pigeons in the bottom row were bred from the common 
rock pigeon at the top of the figure. </p><h2>influence from other scientists on Darwin's theory</h2><p>T_2589</p><p>There
 were three other scientists in particular that influenced Darwin. Their
 names are Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. All three were somewhat older 
than Darwin, and he was familiar with their writings. Jean Baptiste 
Lamarck was a French naturalist. He was one of the first scientists to 
propose that species change over time. In other words, he proposed that 
evolution occurs. Lamarck also tried to explain how it happens, but he 
got that part wrong. Lamarck thought that the traits an organism 
developed during its life time could be passed on to its offspring. He 
called this the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Charles Lyell 
was an English geologist. He wrote a famous book called Principles of 
Geology. Darwin took the book with him on the Beagle. Lyell argued that 
geological processes such as erosion change Earths surface very 
gradually. To account for all the changes that had occurred on the 
planet, Earth must be a lot older than most people believed. Thomas 
Malthus was an English economist. He wrote a popular essay called On 
Population. He argued that human populations have the potential to grow 
faster than the resources they need. When populations get too big, 
disease and famine occur. These calamities control population size by 
killing off the weakest people. </p></div></div>
