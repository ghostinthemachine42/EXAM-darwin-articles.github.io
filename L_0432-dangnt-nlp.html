He says, "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"

He notes that <span class="facetterm-span">animals</span> of the same class often have extremely similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology">embryos</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"></a>. <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen%20whale">baleen</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen%20whale"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen%20whale">whales</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen%20whale"></a>, are found only in embryonic stages.

He mentions his years of work on his <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to "publish this Abstract" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>:</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">James Moore describes how people try to get <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> on the side of their view of nature.

Here, <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> gave people a basis for urging humans not to take control of nature but to cooperate with it. In popular imagination, a scientific <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span> has a single fixed meaning, but in reality it becomes cultural property, and is usable by different interested parties.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching <span class="queryterm-span">evolution</span> through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span> expected species to change slowly, but not at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism">the</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism">same</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism">rate</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic%20gradualism"></a> – some organisms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingula%20(brachiopod)">Lingula</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingula%20(brachiopod)"></a> were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment.

Patterns of extinction matched his <span class="queryterm-span">theory</span>, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Clift">William</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Clift"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Clift">Clift</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Clift"></a> had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text">The <span class="facetterm-span">Voyage</span> of the <span class="facetterm-span">Beagle</span> is the title most commonly given to the book written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Charles</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"> </a><span class="queryterm-span"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Darwin"></a> and published in 1839 as his Journal and Remarks, bringing him considerable fame and respect. This was the third volume of The Narrative of the <span class="facetterm-span">Voyages</span> of H.M.

Due to the popularity of <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s account, the publisher reissued it later in 1839 as <span class="queryterm-span">Darwin</span>'s Journal of Researches, and the revised second edition published in 1845 used this title. A republication of the book in 1905 introduced the title The <span class="facetterm-span">Voyage</span> of the "<span class="facetterm-span">Beagle</span>", by which it is now best known.</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text"><span class="facetterm-span">Beagle</span> was originally scheduled to leave on 24 October 1831 but because of delays in her preparations the departure was delayed until December. Setting forth on what was to become a ground-breaking scientific expedition she departed from Devonport on 10 December. Due to bad weather her first stop was just a few miles ahead, at Barn Pool, on the west side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth%20Sound">Plymouth</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth%20Sound"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth%20Sound">Sound</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth%20Sound"></a>,.

He told his sister that he had "breakfasted yesterday with a Mr. Harris whom I like more than anybody I have seen.— He has written a great deal on Electricity", and wrote to tell his university tutor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow">John</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow">Stevens</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow">Henslow</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Stevens%20Henslow"></a> about his progress, noting that he had met "one or two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr. Thunder &amp; Lightning Harris, whom I daresay you have heard of." In his diary he noted that on the evening of 21 November he attended a "popular lecture from Mr Harris on his lightning conductors" at the Athenaeum. Harris used an "Electric machine" for a thunder cloud and a tub of water for the sea, then with "a toy for a line of battle ship he showed the whole process of it being struck by lightning &amp; most satisfactorily proved how completely his plan protects the vessel from any bad consequences. This plan consists in having plates of Copper folding over each other, let in in the masts &amp; yards &amp; so connected to the water beneath. — The principle, from which these advantages are derived, owes its utility, to the fact that the Electric fluid is weakened by being transmitted over a large surface to such an extent that no effects are perceived, even when the mast is struck by the lightning. — The <span class="facetterm-span">Beagle</span> is fitted with conductors on this plan; it is very probable, we shall be the means of trying &amp; I hope proving the utility of its effects."</p></li><li class="entity-snippet-li"><p class="entity-snippet-li-text"><span class="facetterm-span">Giant</span> <span class="facetterm-span">tortoises</span> are characteristic reptiles that are found on two groups of tropical islands: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldabra">Aldabra</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldabra"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldabra">Atoll</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldabra"></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychelles">Seychelles</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychelles"></a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galapagos</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Islands</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands"></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">Ecuador</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador"></a> (a population at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene%20Islands"> </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene%20Islands">Islands</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene%20Islands"></a> was exterminated by the 1900s) .

It occurs when the size of the <span class="facetterm-span">animals</span> that are isolated on an islands increases dramatically in comparison to their mainland relatives.
